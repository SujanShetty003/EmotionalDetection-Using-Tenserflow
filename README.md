# EmotionalDetection-Using-Tenserflow


OverView:
This project aims to implement emotional detection using TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning library. 
The model is trained to classify emotions based on input data, making it suitable for applications such as sentiment analysis, emotion recognition in text, and more.

Features:
Emotion Classification: The model can classify input data into different emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc.

TensorFlow: Built using TensorFlow, a powerful machine learning framework, providing scalability and ease of use.

Modular Design: The code is organized into modular components, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend.
